## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learnt about the link elements and how to add variables in css.
```html
<link
      rel="icon"
      type="image/png"
      sizes="32x32"
      href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"
    />
```
```css
:root {
  --Very-Dark-Blue: hsl(243, 87%, 12%);
  --Desaturated-Blue: hsl(238, 22%, 44%);
  --Bright-Blue: hsl(224, 93%, 58%);
  --Moderate-Cyan: hsl(170, 45%, 43%);
  --Light-Grayish-Blue: hsl(240, 75%, 98%);
  --Light-Gray: hsl(0, 0%, 75%);

  font-size: 16px;
}
```
  

### Continued development

I still want to continue developing by learning 
- javascript
- node etc


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.fontawesome.com) - this helped me with getting some free fonts and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.googlefonts.com) - this helped me with getting some free fonts and will use it going forward.It is also very easy to use.
